                        <p>In my NFL team statistics project, I utilize advanced machine learning techniques to predict team performance and outcomes. I employ decision tree models to predict the number of wins during the regular season, leveraging historical game data and various team statistics. Furthermore, I use Random Forest and XGBoost classifiers to determine the likelihood of teams making the playoffs or winning the Super Bowl. These models analyze a wide array of features, including player performance, team dynamics, and game conditions, to provide accurate and insightful predictions. The combination of these techniques allows for a robust and comprehensive analysis of team success factors in the NFL.</p>
